            <h1> Garlic & Rosemary Lamb Chops</h1>
            <p><b><i>For The Love of Chops!</b></p></i> 
            <p>
              This relationship with lamb chops started just a few years ago. January 24, 2019 was my first time having lamb chops; at least good ones.
              It was my wife’s birthday and we had her party catered by tonic grille, a black owned business based in Detroit, MI.
              The lamb chops were cooked to a medium temperature with a sweet zip sauce that was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I can still taste it.
              Ever since I have been on a search to find the best lamb chops in the world.

            <h2> Origin of Dish</h2>
            <p> Lamb chops are a rustic dish with an earthy flavor, frequently served alongside cooked carrots, potatoes, and other root vegetables. 
                Often they're accompanied by mushroom gravy or a balsamic reduction. 
                Believe it or not, humans have been eating lamb chops since the beginning of civilization.
                Once man came to his senses, baby sheeps became a delicacy and have been there for over 10,000 years.

            <h3 class="bottomSectionH3"><i>Suggested Sides</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Glazed Carrots.</li>
                <li>Sous Vide Asparagus.</li>

            <h3 class="bottomSectionH3"><i>Suggested Wine Pairings</i></h3>
            <p> Pinot noir, Bordeaux blends, and the Italian reds all pair well with lamb chops, but you can also venture into medium- and full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot if that suits your tastes.
                These pairings are less common than red blends, however, with red wine blends from the Rhône valley in France being the wines most frequently paired with lamb chops.
